Don't have the appreciation for health as a concept, as a kid blessed enough that everyone was healthy as a young kid fresh out of high school break some bones maybe i played hockey but thats it, but i was thrown in an environment at Yara full of people who have spent 30+ years in a hazardous environment, missing fingers legs broken femurs vanadium poisoning ammonia poisoning, working in hazardous environment, watching my crew my friends my people i grew so close with over weekends christmases nights sacrificing themselves for the financial aspect of it, worked with guys with missing legs missing fingers permanent mobility impairments, all of this to provide for their families and to make a better life for them, seeing this made me realize that health truly is wealth, and peoples physical well being provides more value to themself and their family than any financial gain they could've come into at Yara. Strong empathetic effect for them because I'm so close to them but this is truly everyone, construction workers, welders, forestry, power generation, hospitals.
